The life of a butterfly is a journey of transformation, known as **metamorphosis**. It consists of four distinct stages:

### 1. The Egg
It all starts with a tiny egg, usually laid on the underside of a leaf. These eggs are often oval or round and can be beautifully patterned. The female butterfly chooses specific plants (host plants) that will serve as food for the hatching caterpillar.

### 2. The Larva (Caterpillar)
When the egg hatches, a larva (caterpillar) emerges. Its primary job is to eat! Caterpillars grow rapidly, molting their skin several times as they increase in size. This stage is all about gathering energy for the upcoming transformation.

### 3. The Pupa (Chrysalis)
Once the caterpillar has finished growing, it forms a chrysalis (or pupa). Inside this protective casing, a miraculous change occurs. The caterpillar's body breaks down and reorganizes into the adult butterfly's structures—wings, legs, and antennae are formed.

### 4. The Adult Butterfly
Finally, the adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. Its wings are initially wet and crinkled. It must pump fluids into them to expand and dry them before it can take its first flight. The adult stage is primarily for reproduction and dispersal.
